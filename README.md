# Dry well simulation code 
This code simulates flow from a recharge well (drywell) during and following a recharge event.

In order to perform the simulation you will need to provide the following information:
- geometrical properties of the well (depth and diameter), 
- the hydraulic parameters of the porous media (conductivity and porosity), 
- the recharge duration and the recharge rate.

Additionally, you may set the times at which output will be produced.

For a quick example of a typical simulation, run 
`python main.py`
